* ~libgccjit~

This is simply a wrapper around [[https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/jit/][libgccjit]].

The wrapper is generated using a single added ~ifDef~ in the header
file under [[c_sources/libgccjit.h]] using ~c2nim~:

#+begin_src sh
c2nim libgccjit.h
#+end_src
on this modified version.

Note: the original header contains multiple ~typedef~ calls, which are
eaten by ~c2nim~. These correspond to the definitions of the generic
objects used to represent things in ~libgccjit~. We add them back
manually into the Nim wrapper as pure ~objects~.

See the [[examples/hello_world.nim]] for a Nim version of the first
tutorial example, which generates code for a ~greet~ function from
Nim.
